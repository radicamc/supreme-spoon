# supreme-SPOON
supreme-**S**teps to **P**rocess S**O**SS **O**bservatio**N**s

⭐⭐ **Please note that supreme-SPOON has undergone a rebrand and future versions (>=1.4.0) will use a new name, exoTEDRF.** ⭐⭐  
This repository will remain in existence (though it will no longer be updated). All updates to this project will now be [in the exoTEDRF repository](https://github.com/radicamc/exoTEDRF/tree/main). 

**supreme-SPOON** is an end-to-end pipeline for NIRISS/SOSS time series observations (TSOs).
The pipeline is divided into four stages:
 - Stage 1: Detector Level Processing 
 - Stage 2: Spectroscopic Processing
 - Stage 3: 1D Spectral Extraction
 - Stage 4: Light Curve Fitting (optional)

## Installation Instructions
The latest release of **supreme-SPOON** can be downloaded from PyPI by running:

    pip install supreme_spoon

Depending on the operating system, the package jmespath may fail to install. In this case, run ```pip install jmespath```, and then proceed with the **supreme-SPOON** installation.

The default pip installation only includes Stages 1 to 3. Stage 4 can be included via specifying the following option during installation:

    pip install supreme_spoon[stage4]

Note that the radvel package may fail to build during the installation of Stage4. If so, simply run ```pip install cython```, and then proceed with the **supreme-SPOON** installation as before.

The latest development version can be grabbed from GitHub (inlcludes all pipeline stages):

    git clone https://github.com/radicamc/supreme-spoon
    cd supreme_spoon
    python setup.py install

Note that **supreme-SPOON** is currently compatible with python 3.10.4 and v1.12.5 of the jwst package maintained by STScI. If you wish to run a 
different version of jwst, certain functionalities of **supreme-SPOON** may not work.

## Usage Instructions
The **supreme-SPOON** pipeline can be run in a similar fashion to jwst by individually calling each step.
Alternatively, Stages 1 to 3 can be run at once via the ```run_DMS.py``` script.

1. Copy the ```run_DMS.py``` script and the ```run_DMS.yaml``` config file into your working directory.
2. Fill out the yaml file with the appropriate inputs.
3. Once happy with the input parameters, enter ```python run_DMS.py run_DMS.yaml``` in the terminal.

To use the light curve fitting capabilities (if installed), simply follow the same procedure with the fit_lightcurves.py and .yaml files. 

### ATOCA Caveats
**supreme-SPOON** has the ability to run the ATOCA extraction algorithm to explicitly model the overlap of the first and second SOSS spectral orders on the detector. 
ATOCA is now the default extract1d method in the STScI jwst pipeline, however, since jwst v1.9.0 it is partially broken. In order to use ATOCA, you must install jwst v1.8.5. 
You may also need to specifically install astropy v5.3.4 and asdf v2.15.2. All other pipeline functionalities should work with this jwst version.
With jwst v1.8.5 a pipeline error ```stpipe.config_parser.ValidationError: Extra value 'edge_size' in root``` may be encountered during the JumpStep, if specifying ```fit_up_ramp=True```. This comes from a STScI update to the JumpStep parameter file which is not backwards compatible. 
To circumvent this error, one can download an older version of the parameter file from the [CRDS](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu). Navigate to the niriss downdown menu, and then to pars-jumpstep. Download the file jwst_niriss_pars-jumpstep_0020.asdf. 
Then rename it jwst_niriss_pars-jumpstep_0081.asdf (or whichever is the most recent version) and replace the automatically downloaded parameter file in your crds_cache directory.
